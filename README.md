üìñ Overview
In modern emergency response scenarios ‚Äî whether it's natural disasters, fire outbreaks, or medical emergencies ‚Äî rapid assessment and assistance can save lives. This project presents a drone-based system equipped with real-time obstacle avoidance capabilities, designed specifically for emergency services operations. Using an integration of sensors, embedded systems, and advanced algorithms, this drone autonomously navigates complex environments (urban areas, forests, disaster zones) while avoiding obstacles to deliver essential supplies, provide visual data, or assist in search and rescue missions.

üéØ Objectives
1. Design and develop a multi-rotor drone capable of autonomous flight with obstacle avoidance.
2. Implement a real-time navigation system using computer vision and proximity sensors.
3. Enable the drone to carry a payload (up to 1000 grams) for emergency supplies.
4. Integrate communication systems for live video feed and telemetry data.
5. Deploy deep learning-based object detection for identifying survivors or hazards in emergency areas.

üìë Project Workflow

Phase 1: Basic Drone Assembly & Manual Control
Assemble quadcopter frame, motors, ESCs, flight controller.
Calibrate hardware via Mission Planner or QGroundControl.
Establish manual control with RC transmitter.

Phase 2: Integrating Obstacle Detection
Mount ultrasonic sensors (front, left, right).
Implement distance monitoring via Arduino or onboard companion computer.
Program avoidance algorithm:
If object detected within threshold (e.g., 50cm), reroute flight path.

Phase 3: Computer Vision Integration
Attach a camera module.
Use OpenCV to detect obstacles (walls, trees, people) via image processing.
Combine sensor data + vision for enhanced obstacle detection.

Phase 4: Autonomous Navigation
Integrate GPS waypoints and automated missions using Mission Planner.
Implement dynamic path adjustment using sensor and vision inputs.

Phase 5: Payload Delivery Mechanism
Design and attach a secure payload dropping/releasing mechanism.
Test weight endurance and balance adjustment.

Phase 6: Live Video Feed & Telemetry
Set up FPV camera with video transmitter.
Use telemetry modules to stream live data (altitude, battery, GPS, sensor inputs).

Phase 7: AI-based Survivor Detection (Advanced)
Train a CNN model (YOLO, MobileNet-SSD, or custom VQ-VAE for anomaly detection).
Deploy model on a Jetson Nano / Raspberry Pi for real-time detection.
Highlight potential survivors or hazards on the live feed.

üìàFuture Improvements
1. Integrate SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) for mapping unknown environments.
2. Implement autonomous landing in tight areas using computer vision.
3. Enhance AI models for multi-class object detection (human, fire, flood debris).
4. Introduce 5G/LoRaWAN communication modules for wider operational range.
